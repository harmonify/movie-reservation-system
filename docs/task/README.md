# Task

## Filename

The documents' filename are prefixed with the letter `T`, followed by 3 numbers.

Backlogs are prefixed with `Z`.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

Although the initial plan was to use this folder to store both product and technical tasks, I found it more convenient to keep track only product tasks here.

Technical things, e.g. new tech-y stuff, improvements, refactoring, etc., are more convenient to be documented using Git commit messages. So, you should check the Git commit history if you are interested with that.
